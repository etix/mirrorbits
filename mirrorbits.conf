## Path to the local repository
# Repository: /srv/repo

## Path to the templates (default autodetect)
# Templates: /usr/share/mirrorbits/

## A local path or URL containing the JavaScript used by the templates.
## If this is not set (the default), the JavaScript will just be loaded
## from the usual CDNs. See also `contrib/localjs/fetchfiles.sh`.
# LocalJSPath:

## Path where to store logs (comment to disable)
# LogDir: /var/log/mirrorbits

## Path to the GeoIP2 mmdb databases
# GeoipDatabasePath: /usr/share/GeoIP/

## OutputMode can take on the three values:
##  - redirect: HTTP redirect to the destination file on the selected mirror
##  - json: return a json document for pre-treatment by an application
##  - auto: based on the Accept HTTP header
# OutputMode: auto

## Enable Gzip compression
# Gzip: false

## Interval in seconds between which 2 range downloads of a given file
## from a same origin (hashed (IP, user-agent) couple) are considered
## to be the same download. In particular, download statistics are not
## incremented for this file.
# SameDownloadInterval: 600

## Host and port to listen on
# ListenAddress: :8080

## Host and port to listen for the CLI RPC
# RPCListenAddress: localhost:3390

## Redis host and port
# RedisAddress: 10.0.0.1:6379

## Redis password (if any)
# RedisPassword: supersecure

## Redis database ID (if any)
# RedisDB: 0

## Redis sentinel name (only if using sentinel)

## List of Redis sentinel hosts (only if using sentinel)
# RedisSentinels:
#     - Host: 10.0.0.1:26379

##### MIRRORS #####
###################

## Relative path to the trace file within the repository (optional).
## The file must contain the number of seconds since epoch and should
## be updated every minute (or so) with a cron on the master repository.
# TraceFileLocation: /trace

## Interval between two scans of the local repository.
## The repository scan will index new and removed files and collect file
## sizes and checksums.
## This should, more or less, match the frequency where the local repo
## is updated.
# RepositoryScanInterval: 5

## Enable or disable specific hashing algorithms
# Hashes:
#     SHA256: On
#     SHA1: Off
#     MD5: Off

## Maximum number of concurrent mirror synchronization to do (rsync/ftp) 
# ConcurrentSync: 5

## Interval in minutes between mirror scan
# ScanInterval: 30

## Interval in minutes between mirrors HTTP health checks
# CheckInterval: 1

## Allow a mirror to issue an HTTP redirect.
## Setting this to true will disable the mirror if a redirect is detected.
# DisallowRedirects: false

## Disable a mirror if an active file is missing (HTTP 404)
# DisableOnMissingFile: false

## Adjust the weight/range of the geographic distribution
# WeightDistributionRange: 1.5

## Maximum number of alternative links to return in the HTTP header
# MaxLinkHeaders: 10

## Automatically fix timezone offsets.
## Enable this if one or more mirrors are always excluded because their
## last-modification-time mismatch. This option will try to guess the
## offset and adjust the mod time accordingly.
## Affected mirrors will need to be rescanned after enabling this feature.
# FixTimezoneOffsets: false

## List of mirrors to use as fallback which will be used in case mirrorbits
## is unable to answer a request because the database is unreachable.
## Note: Mirrorbits will redirect to one of these mirrors based on the user
## location but won't be able to know if the mirror has the requested file.
## Therefore only put your most reliable and up-to-date mirrors here.
# Fallbacks:
#     - URL: http://fallback1.mirror/repo/
#       CountryCode: fr
#       ContinentCode: eu
#     - URL: http://fallback2.mirror/repo/
