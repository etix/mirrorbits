Mirrorbits
===========

Mirrorbits is a geographical download redirector written in [Go](https://golang.org) for distributing files efficiently across a set of mirrors. It offers a simple and economic way to create a Content Delivery Network layer using a pure software stack. It is primarily designed for the distribution of large-scale Open-Source projects with a lot of traffic.

## Main Features

* Blazing fast, can reach 8K QPS on a single laptop
* Easy to deploy and maintain, everything is packed in a single binary
* Automatic synchronization with the mirrors over **rsync** or **FTP**
* Response can be either JSON or HTTP redirect
* Support partial repositories
* Complete checksum / size control
* Realtime monitoring and reports
* Disable misbehaving mirrors without human intervention
* Realtime decision making based on location, AS number and defined rules
* Smart load-balancing over multiple mirrors in the same area to avoid hotspots
* Ability to adjust the weight of each mirror
* Limit access to a country, region or ASN for any mirror
* Clustering (multiple mirrorbits instances)
* High-availability using redis-sentinel
* Automatically fix timezone offsets for broken mirrors
* Realtime statistics per file / mirror / date
* Realtime reconfiguration
* Seamless binary upgrade (aka zero downtime upgrade)
* [Mirmon](http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~penni101/mirmon/) support
* Full **IPv6** support
* more...

## Is it production ready?

**Yes!** Mirrorbits has served **billions** of files already and is known to be running in production at:
* [CarbonROM](https://carbonrom.org/)
* [Chaos Computer Club](https://media.ccc.de/) to distribute media
* [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) since [April 2021](https://jellyfin.org/posts/mirrorbits-cdn/)
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to distribute Jenkins releases since [February 2020](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-mirrorbits)
* [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/) (previously XBMC) since [July 2015](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=233824)
* [LineageOS](http://lineageos.org/) (previously CyanogenMod) since January 2017
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) to distribute packages (deb/rpm) for Linux distributions since [December 2021](https://mariadb.org/mirrorbits/)
* [OSMC](https://osmc.tv)
* [VideoLAN](http://www.videolan.org/) to distribute [VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) since [April 2014](https://blog.l0cal.com/2014/07/11/mirrorbits-is-now-on-github/)
* [Endless OS](https://endlessos.org/os)

Yet some things might change before the 1.0 release. If you intend to deploy Mirrorbits in a production system it is advised to notify the author first so we can help you to make any transition as seamless as possible!

_Previous projects which have used Mirrorbits:_
* [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org)
* [Popcorn Time](https://popcorntime.io)
* [SuperRepo](https://superrepo.org)

# Quick start

## Prerequisites

* Go 1.11 or later
* Protobuf (protoc)
* Redis 3.2 or later (with [persistence](https://redis.io/topics/persistence) enabled)
* GeoIP2 databases from [Maxmind](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) (preferably updated regularly)

:warning: **GeoIP-legacy is not supported anymore, please use the new GeoIP2 mmdb databases!**

**Optional:**

* redis-sentinel (for high-availability support)

## Upgrading

Before upgrading to the latest version, please check [this guide](https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits/wiki/Upgrade-Guide).

## Installation

You can either get a [prebuilt version](https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits/releases) or choose to build it yourself.

### Docker

A docker "quick start" can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits/wiki/Running-within-Docker).

### Manual build


Go >= 1.11:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits.git
$ cd mirrorbits
$ sudo make install
```

Go < 1.11:
```
$ go get -u github.com/etix/mirrorbits
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/etix/mirrorbits
$ sudo make install
```

The resulting executable should now live in your */usr/local/bin* directory. You can also specify a `PREFIX` or `DESTDIR` if necessary:
```
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```

## Configuration

A sample configuration file can be found [here](mirrorbits.conf).

## Running

Mirrorbits is a self-contained application and can act, at the same time, as the server and the cli.

To run the server:
```
mirrorbits daemon
```
Additional options can be found with ```mirrorbits -help```.

To run the cli:
```
mirrorbits help
```

Add a mirror:
```
mirrorbits add -ftp="ftp://ftp.mirrors.example/myproject/" -http="http://ftp.mirrors.example/myproject/" mirrors.example
```

Enable the mirror:
```
mirrorbits enable mirrors.example
```

### Realtime file availability

By appending `?mirrorlist` to any file served by mirrorbits, you'll be able to get some useful realtime informations about the given file. You can see a [live example here](https://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.4/win32/vlc-2.2.4-win32.exe?mirrorlist).

### Realtime mirrors statistics

Mirror statistics are available by querying mirrorbits with the `?mirrorstats` argument. You can see a [live example here](https://get.videolan.org/?mirrorstats).

## Clustering / High availability

Multiple instances of mirrorbits can be started simultaneously on different servers, discovery of other nodes should be automatic as long as all the instances are connected to the same redis server. In addition to the clustering it is advised to use redis-sentinel to monitor the database and gracefully handle failover.

## Upgrading

Mirrorbits has a mode called *seamless binary upgrade* to upgrade the server executable at runtime without service disruption. Once the binary has been replaced on the filesystem just issue the following command in the cli:
```
mirrorbits upgrade
```

## Considerations

* When configured in redirect mode, Mirrorbits can easily serve client requests directly but it is usually recommended to set it behind a reverse proxy like nginx. In this case take care to pass the IP address of the client within a X-Forwarded-For header:
```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
```
* It is advised to never cache requests intended for Mirrorbits since each request is supposed to be unique, caching the result might have unexpected consequences.
